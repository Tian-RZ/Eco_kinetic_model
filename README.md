# Eco_kinetic_model

## Description
This repository contains a kinetic model of Escherichia coli cell growth and GlcNAc biosynthesis, the MATLAB code are provided as Eco_GlcNAc.m  

>The development of the kinetic model was mainly based on four kinetics, including the growth kinetic model of acetic acid-producing E. coli developed by Luli et al., Monod equation describing nutrient limitation, acetate synthesis and specific growth rate equations determined by Basan et al., and Michaelis-Menten equation describing the biosynthesis pathway of GlcNAc.   
>This model mainly captures three characteristics of engineered E. coli in fermentation experiments:   
>>1) addition of pAcF can change the specific growth rate by regulating the flux of the glycolytic pathway;  
>>2) accumulation of acetate can inhibit both cell growth and biosynthesis of target metabolites and acetate;  
>>3) cell growth is also limited by the concentration of nutrients (especially nitrogen sources) in the medium.  
>Besides, concentrations of metabolites and all parameters in the model are expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.) which is sufficient to qualitatively simulate the dynamic characteristics of metabolites and biomass.
